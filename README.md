# abtrivia

This is the back-end code for the Fitbit app AB Trivia by Snowy Studios. It performs a daily call to the Open Trivia Database every morning and stores the results in a PostgreSQL database so that all users receive the same questions each day. 

More information about the app can be found at http://abtrivia.herokuapp.com/.
